"""
Booleans are a data type that can hold one of two values: True or False. 
They are often used in conditional statements to control the flow of a program. 
"""

# You can store a boolean in a variable like this:
my_boolean = True

# You can also store the result of a comparison in a variable:
a = 10
b = 5
result = a > b
print(result)
# What is the value of result?

# What do you think "a < b" will return?
# What about "a == b"?
