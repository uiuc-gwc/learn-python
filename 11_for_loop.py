# We can also set a loop to run a certain number of times.
# for example
for i in range(6):
    print(i)

# What do you notice? Does the output start at 0 or 1?
# Does it print 6?

# Write a loop that prints the numbers 0 to 10 (including 10). 


# Write a loop that prints the numbers 1 to 10 (including 1 and 10).
