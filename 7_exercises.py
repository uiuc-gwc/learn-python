# We're going to do a quick review! 
# You're going to input two numbers and then do a bit of math with them. 
# Run this code as-is and see what happens first. 
inp1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
inp2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Print "The num of your numbers is: " and then the sum of the two numbers.

# Print "The difference of your numbers is: " and then the difference of the two numbers.

# Print "The product of your numbers is: " and then the product of the two numbers.

# Print "The quotient of your numbers is: " and then the quotient of the two numbers.

# Print "(first number) mod (second number):" and then the remainder of the two numbers.

# Print "Is the first number greater than the second number?" and then the result of the comparison.

# Print "Is the first number equal to the second number?" and then the result of the comparison.

# Print "Is the first number less than OR EQUAL TO the second number?" and then the result of the comparison.
