# You can make a variable to store your values. 
# (This works the same way variables work in Scratch! )
# Try storing the number 10 into a variable called "my_number" and printing it.
# Here's an example of storing 4.5 into a variable called "my_decimal":
my_decimal = 4.5


# you can print the variable by using the print() function like this:
print(my_decimal)

# If you want something fancy, you can print your variable like so:
print(f"{my_decimal}=")
# (Remember to test your code! )

# You can store anything as a variable.
