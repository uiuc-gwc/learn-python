# Write some code to print all the odd numbers between 1 and 100. 
# Your code should be less than 10 lines long! 


# Write some code to add up all the numbers between 1 and 100. 
# print the answer. 


'''
Write code that generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and continues 
until it reaches a number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5. 
For each number in the sequence, check the following conditions:

    If the number is even, print "Even: [number]".
    If the number is odd, print "Odd: [number]".
    If the number is a prime number, print "Prime: [number]".

The program should stop when it reaches a number that is a 
multiple of both 3 and 5, and print "Reached the end at: [number]".

# CHALLENGE: 
# Write some code to print all the factors of a number 
# (just set a variable with the number you want to find the factors of).
# If you want, you can use input() to get the number from the user.
